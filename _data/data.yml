  details: |
      I am interested in Operating Systems and Computer Architecture, particularly in the areas of memory management and parallel processing.

      Currently, my research centers on enhancing memory and storage systems using OS-level virtualization techniques.

      In the past, I worked on optimizing Code Generation systems like QEMU, where I focused on improving their parallel performance and ensuring correctness.

      Feel free to reach out—I'm always open to knowledge exchange and connecting with others!

  #I am currently a research assistant in [Nankai University](http://en.nankai.edu.cn/), working with Prof. [Gong Xiaoli](https://cc.nankai.edu.cn/2019/0619/c13620a179396/page.htm). Before that,

      Hey there! I'm Ziyi (pronounced `\Zee-E\`), a 5th-year Ph.D. student at [Rice University](https://csweb.rice.edu/){:target="_blank"}.
      I focus on Memory Systems research, particularly heterogeneous systems that combine different memory types and processors like GPUs and CPUs. 
      I work with [Prof. Scott Rixner](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~rixner/){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. Alan Cox](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/alan-l-cox){:target="_blank"}.

      I am currently also a part-time intern at NVIDIA, where I work on GPU page migration algorithms to enhance GPU performance and enable larger models to run efficiently on GPUs with limited memory capacity.

      I earned my Bachelor's degree from [Nankai University](https://en.nankai.edu.cn/){:target="_blank"}, where I had the fortune to do research on QEMU with 
      [Prof. Xiaoli Gong](https://cc.nankai.edu.cn/2019/0619/c13620a179396/page.htm){:target="_blank"}, 
      [Prof. Pen-Chung Yew](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~yew/){:target="_blank"}, 
      and [Prof. Wenwen Wang](https://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~wenwen/){:target="_blank"}.

    - role: System Software Engineer Intern
      time: 2025.05 - 2025.08
      company: NVIDIA
      tag: 
      location: Santa Clara, CA
      details: |
        + Working on GPU memory systems within the CUDA UVM team, focusing on OS- and runtime-level mechanisms for datacenter workloads. Architected and implemented a selective page migration system that enables transparent data movement between CPU and GPU memory with minimal hardware support, improving GPU execution efficiency without requiring application code changes.
        + Delivered up to 17% performance gains on recommendation system workloads compared to hand-tuned memory management, and 66–100× speedups over Unified Virtual Memory (UVM), with additional 1–4× improvements on LLM and HPC workloads.

    - role: System Software Engineer Intern
      time: 2024.05 - 2024.08
      company: NVIDIA
      tag:
      location: Santa Clara, CA
      details: |
        + Worked on GPU memory systems within the CUDA UVM team, focusing on performance characterization for datacenter-scale workloads. Developed a suite of microbenchmarks to analyze GPU memory access patterns and identify bottlenecks across the memory hierarchy in both hardware and software.
        + Performed in-depth analysis of memory access and address translation behavior (e.g., TLB coverage and page table walks), and delivered insights that directly informed architectural decisions for next-generation GPUs.

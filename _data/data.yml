  title: Biography
  #I am currently a research assistant in [Nankai University](http://en.nankai.edu.cn/), working with Prof. [Gong Xiaoli](https://cc.nankai.edu.cn/2019/0619/c13620a179396/page.htm). Before that, 
  details: |
      I obtained my Bachelor degree in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cc.nankai.edu.cn/main.htm), [Nankai University](http://en.nankai.edu.cn/) in 2020. 
      During this time, I got interested in computer systems and became a research assistant. 
      I participated in several related research projects, under the supervision of Prof. [Xiaoli Gong](https://cc.nankai.edu.cn/2019/0619/c13620a179396/page.htm), also with guidances from
      Prof. [Pen-Chung Yew](https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~yew/)
      and Prof. [Wenwen Wang](http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~wenwen/).
      Now I've got three papers accepted and two papers submitted. I'm enjoying the research and looking for a Ph.D. position now.
      
      My research interests include but not limit to: computer systems, architectures, parallel and high performance computing. Current areas of focus include: cross-ISA virtualization and dynamic binary translation, and efficient parallel program emulation techniques for many-core systems.

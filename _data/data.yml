  details: |
      I am interested in Operating Systems and Computer Architecture, particularly in the areas of memory management and parallel processing.

      Currently, my research centers on enhancing memory and storage systems using OS-level virtualization techniques.

      In the past, I worked on optimizing Code Generation systems like QEMU, where I focused on improving their parallel performance and ensuring correctness.

      Feel free to reach out—I'm always open to knowledge exchange and connecting with others!

      Hey there! I'm Ziyi (pronounced `\Zee-E\`), a 4th-year Ph.D. student at [Rice University](https://csweb.rice.edu/){:target="_blank"}.
      I focus on Memory Systems research, particularly heterogeneous systems that combine different memory types and processors like GPUs and CPUs. 
      I work with [Prof. Scott Rixner](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~rixner/){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. Alan Cox](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/alan-l-cox){:target="_blank"}.

      I am currently also a part-time intern at NVIDIA, where I work on GPU page migration algorithms to enhance GPU performance and enable larger models to run efficiently on GPUs with limited memory capacity.

      I earned my Bachelor's degree from [Nankai University](https://en.nankai.edu.cn/){:target="_blank"}, where I had the fortune to do research on QEMU with 
      [Prof. Xiaoli Gong](https://cc.nankai.edu.cn/2019/0619/c13620a179396/page.htm){:target="_blank"}, 
      [Prof. Pen-Chung Yew](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~yew/){:target="_blank"}, 
      and [Prof. Wenwen Wang](https://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~wenwen/){:target="_blank"}.

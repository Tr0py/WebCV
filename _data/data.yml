  details: |
      I am interested in Operating Systems and Computer Architecture, with a focus on **memory management** and **parallel processing**.

      I am currently focused on improving **memory and storage systems** with OS-level virtualization techniques.

      Previously, I had experiences in improving cross-ISA Dynamic Binary Translation systems such as QEMU, with a focus on **improving their parallel performance and correctness**.

      Knowledge exchange is very welcomed!
